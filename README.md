## Overview

This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG19 architecture, to develop a robust system for automated detection of cataracts in human eye images. The goal is to provide a non-invasive, scalable, and cost-effective solution for early cataract diagnosis and improve ophthalmic healthcare accessibility.

## Built with

- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras
- Model Architecture: VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Sublime Text

## Dataset

![Fundus Images](./image.png)
- The project utilized fundus images sourced from multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset comprised images of cataract and non-cataract cases, curated to ensure diversity and balance. Details of the datasets and their preprocessing are as follows:

# Kaggle

- [Cataract Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandanp6/cataract-image-dataset)
- [Cataract Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jr2ngb/cataractdataset/data)
- [Eye Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification)

# GitHub

- [Cataract Detection Dataset](https://github.com/krishnabojha/Cataract_Detection-using-CNN)

# Preprocessing Steps:

- Resized images to 224x224 pixels.
- Normalized pixel values to range [0,1].
- Applied data augmentation (rotation, scaling, and flipping) to address dataset imbalance and improve generalization.

# Data Augmentation:

- Random rotation up to Â±30 degrees.
- Horizontal flipping.
- Scaling transformations.
- Resulted in the addition of 6000 augmented training images.
